### :mag: Barcode support {id="barcodes"}
Are you present in the United States? Europe? Or maybe on an island in the Pacific? 
Depending on the legal realm within which your store locations operate, your products' Universal Product Codes
(UPCs) or European Article Numbers (EANs) will need to comply with <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes">the relevant standards</a>.

Typically, UPCs are used in retail settings across the United States and Canada. While, EANs are the European equivalent.
If you don't see your barcode format below, please get in touch at [info@pendoo.io](mailto:info@pendoo.io).
