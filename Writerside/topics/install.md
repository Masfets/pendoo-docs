# Installation :package:

>   <b>Prerequisite</b> :construction:<br/>
    To install the app, a Shopify account with an active Shopify shop is required. You must either be the shop owner or have 
    the appropriate permissions to carry out the installation.

### :electric_plug: Shop connection {id="connect-your-shop"}

<note>
    The initial connection allows us to prepare the stage by creating the necessary foundation upon
    which the installation will be carried out. Most importantly, we set up a 2-way communication channel that is used exclusively
    between you, the retailer, and us, the sales channel. This channel is created on a per-retailer basis to ensure data security and integrity.
</note>


<tip>
    Currently, the default platform integration is with Shopify. This may change in the future as we will be releasing more 
    integrations.

</tip>

Enter your domain, the email address associated with your Shopify account and click <b>Connect</b>.
<u>Establishing a connection can take up to 3 minutes to complete</u>.

<note>
    The domain can either be the custom domain you use for your Shopify shop, e.g. <b>my-store.com</b>, or it could be
    your permanent Shopify address, e.g. <b>my-store.myshopify.com</b>.

This is where the magic starts - you can now install the app. Go ahead, click on <b>Install now</b>! <br/><br/>
> <b>Access scopes</b> - <i><a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#authenticated-access-scopes">what are Shopify access scopes?</a></i><br/><br/>
To facilitate the creation and processing of orders and in order for Pendoo to route them appropriately to your shop and/or specific location,
certain access scopes are required. These include scopes around <i>products</i>, <i>customers</i>, <i>orders</i>, <i>locations</i> and <i>fulfillments</i>.
They will be explicitly requested upon installation. <br/><br/>If you have questions or concerns, please get in touch with us at
[info@pendoo.io](mailto:info@pendoo.io).

### :space_invader: QR Code placement {id="qr-code"}
Your customers will scan the QR code to launch the Pendoo web-app. 
You will find your store's QR code(s) in your Pendoo account dashboard.

In your store, **the strategic placement of QR codes is key**. The goal is for your customers to have easy access to your checkout points, which is what your QR codes really are!
Depending on your store's layout, this could mean a single larger QR code at the entrance. Or maybe at checkout. 
For bigger stores, we recommend the placement of smaller QR codes per product section. This way, 
your customers can easily launch the app and check out without having to carry their items from section to section. 

After all, we are trying to make things easier, not complicate them :relieved:
