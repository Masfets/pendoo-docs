# Installation :package:

    the appropriate permissions to carry out the installation.

<note>
    The initial connection allows us to prepare the stage by creating the necessary foundation upon
    which the installation will be carried out. Most importantly, we set up a 2-way communication channel that is used exclusively
    between you, the retailer, and us, the sales channel. This channel is created on a per-retailer basis to ensure data security and integrity.
</note>


<tip>
    Currently, the default platform integration is with Shopify. This may change in the future as we will be releasing more 
    integrations.

Enter your domain, the email address associated with your Shopify account and click <b>Connect</b>.
<u>Establishing a connection can take up to 3 minutes to complete</u>.

<note>
    The domain can either be the custom domain you use for your Shopify shop, e.g. <b>my-store.com</b>, or it could be
    your permanent Shopify address, e.g. <b>my-store.myshopify.com</b>.
