# Getting started :books:

A friendly guide to help our retail partners get started with introducing <b><a href="https://pendoo.io">Pendoo</a></b> to their brick-and-mortar stores.
The <b>real</b> new era of retail awaits, so let's get going :rocket:


## :microscope: What's Pendoo? {id="what-is-pendoo"}
><b>Ad valorem</b> :tophat:<br/>
>In Latin? Well, <i>pendo</i> relates to the concept of <i>value</i>. And Pendoo? Think 
>of it as <i>value added</i>, or <i>value+</i>, if you will. We have added an extra O, you see...

On the face of it, Pendoo is a <b>scan-and-go</b> technology. It allows retail consumers to use their mobile device to scan 
product barcodes, add them to their digital basket and ultimately check-out. All on their device.

**Pendoo is distributed as a web-application**. From a consumer-perspective, this means that we eliminate the need for a native application download, 
like an iOS or Android application. While we appreciate a big part of the consumer audience have grown to like native applications (who doesn't, right?), in this 
instance we feel that the saying <i>there's a time and a place</i> is quite fitting. 
Our priorities are such that a download requirement would severely hinder our barrier-less setup. 

Ultimately, we aim at making it as easy as possible for retail customers to complete a checkout as quickly and painlessly as possible. 
All the while, retail staff are reallocated onto shop-floor-critical tasks, instead of carrying out transactions. 

Let's re-think retail. Let's re-build it around a key pillar: <u>human interaction</u>. Let's promote human ingenuity and 
**let's not confine our retail staff behind a screen - portable or not**.

><b>Plug-and-Play</b> :circus_tent: <br/>
>Pendoo integrates seamlessly with <a href="https://shopify.com"><b>Shopify</b></a> in the form of a <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps">custom app</a>.
>As a true <i>plug-and-play</i> solution, integrating Pendoo takes less than 5 minutes and requires <b>no</b> additional work.
>We are currently working on introducing stable integrations with other popular platforms such as <a href="https://lightspeedhq.com">Lightspeed</a> and <a href="https://squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>.
