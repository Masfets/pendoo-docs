# Features :sparkles:
We have been working with retailers in various markets with a range of different requirements. This exposure offers us a
prime opportunity to recognise patterns in some of our retailers' most pressing issues when it comes to their customers' shopping experiences.

<note>Introducing new software tools to your team almost always comes with overhead. So much so, that it can even feel 
counter-productive at times. Let's <b>not</b> do that this time! Let us take care of the admin while your customers shop away. 
Below are some of the <b>key features that enable us to streamline our operations</b> without you worrying about a thing.
</note>

#### :credit_card: Payment methods {id="payment-methods"}
Every market has different methods of payment that are popular among its retail shoppers. We
strive to be flexible regardless of geography. Beyond <b><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></b> and
<b><a href="https://pay.google.com/intl/en/about/">Google Pay</a></b>, maybe you are considering 
accepting payments in installments from your customers? Let them pay with <b><a href="https://www.klarna.com/">Klarna</a></b>. 
Or maybe you have presence in Denmark and/or Finland - why not use <b><a href="https://mobilepaygroup.com/">MobilePay</a></b>? 

Default payment methods include **Apple Pay** and **Google Pay**. <br/><br/>Are you missing a payment method you were hoping to
offer to your customers? Let us know at [info@pendoo.io](mailto:info@pendoo.io).

#### :earth_africa: Localisation {id="localisation"}
Regardless of how prominent the English language is, **localisation has been proven to increase customer satisfaction
and, ultimately, revenue.** As Pendoo enters new markets around the world, we work closely with our retail partners on
localising our service so your customers can feel comfortable using your new mobile self-checkout.

After all, Pendoo <tooltip term="so-cool">er utrolig</tooltip>!

#### :woman_superhero: Customer record {id="customer-record-creation"}
Upon a user's successful transaction, <b>a customer record is created or updated in your Shopify admin</b>. <br/><br/>During checkout, the user's
email address is used to perform a look-up. If a customer record is found, the order will be created against their existing record and will
be appended to their order history. <br/><br/>
Otherwise, a new customer record will be created along with their first order.

#### :round_pushpin: Location-aware sales {id="location-sale-attribution"}
Running a Shopify shop with **multiple locations**? Reporting can be a nightmare when it shouldn't be!<br/><br/> As an omnipresent sales-channel,
we don't just blindly fulfill orders. **We route the order to the location where the sale took place**, update the fulfillment order's
assigned location and ultimately fulfill the order.

Your reports have never looked neater :broom:

#### :performing_arts: Branding {id="branding-and-customisation"}
Set your brand elements, starting with your logo, to determine how the Pendoo checkout appears to your customers.
You can even use your domain as a Pendoo subdomain, making it clear to your customers that mobile self-checkout is an
extension of your company's shopping experience. <br/>

As we continue to develop our product, more customisation options will become available.

#### :lock: Anti-theft {id="anti-theft"}
Pendoo collaborates with leading anti-theft solutions providers, such as <a href="https://nedap.com/">Nedap</a>,
to enhance our security offerings and ensure robust protection for our retail partners. Are you using RFID? Or magnetic tags?
We are interested to hear your approach and are ready to devise a secure plan for you. Get in touch at [info@pendoo.io](mailto:info@pendoo.io).
